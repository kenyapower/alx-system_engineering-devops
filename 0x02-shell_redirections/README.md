Task 0: echo hello world and a new line
task 1: add a confused smiley face
Task 2: use the cat command to display the file passwd
Task 3: i am using the spaced cat cmd to display 2 files, notice where spacing is done.
Task 4: use the tail cmd to display last 10 lines of file. by default tail cmd shows only 10lines but you can initiate a number before path of file to show specific number of lines
Task 5: learn hoe to use the head cmd. same as the tail cmd, head cmd displays first 10 lines by default. You can also specify the number of lines you wish to view using eg (head -8 /etc/passwd) to view the first 8 lines.
